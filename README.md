I added Travis badge for lulz. Looks cool!

## About Ticketee

This is a simple ticket tracking app, which will serve me as a kind of reference.
It is based on the original Ticketee app from [Rails 4 in Action book](https://www.manning.com/books/rails-4-in-action)

I've modified it to use Haml (which i love) and Postgres.

The book is great, if you are starting with Rails, read it! It teaches you to use production-grade set of gems, such as: 

* Capybara
* RSpec
* Bootstrap
* Simple Form
* Devise
* Pundit
* CarrierWave

It also shows how to use Heroku, Mailgun and Travis for deployment.
Good stuff, learned so much from it.

### How to use it
